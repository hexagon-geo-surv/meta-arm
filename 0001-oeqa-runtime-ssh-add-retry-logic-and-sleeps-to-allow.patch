Subject: [PATCH] oeqa/runtime/ssh: add retry logic and sleeps to allow for
 slower systems

On exceptionally slow systems, the ssh test can intermittently fail due
to a race between when ping works and the networking applications being
brought up.  To work around this issue, add some retry logic when ssh
fails to connect.  According to the man page of ssh, "ssh exits
with the exit status of the remote command or with 255 if an error
occurred."  So, only retry if the return code is 255, and limit the
number of retries to prevent it looping forever.
